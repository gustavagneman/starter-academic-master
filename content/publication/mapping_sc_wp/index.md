abstract: "The ability of states to exercise authority often varies considerably within their
borders. Yet, the empirical literature on state capacity has typically relied on
country-level indicators of state capacity. In this paper, we develop a measure
of local state capacity for all five-kilometer grid cells across Sub-Saharan Africa.
The measure builds on geocoded survey data on local state presence, which we
predict and extrapolate through a machine learning model using readily available
data on the costs and benefits of capacity building across space. We showcase
the usefulness of measuring state capacity at a local level by employing the index
as a moderating factor in the relationship between oil wealth and violent conflict
and show that areas with higher levels of state capacity face lower risks of conflict
outbreak due to exogenous oil wealth shocks."

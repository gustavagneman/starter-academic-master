"2","The site has been served under the directory ""C:/Users/gusta/Desktop/Website/starter-academic-master"". I have tried to reopen it for you with servr::browse_last(). If you do want to start a new server, you may stop existing servers with blogdown::stop_server(), or restart R. Normally you should not need to serve the same site multiple times in the same R session, otherwise you may run into issues like https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/404.
